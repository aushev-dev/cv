            Hi, I'm a Software Engineer with experience in developing web applications and integrating third-party services
            through private APIs. I am proficient in building Docker images, using Dry-rb for creating composable, reusable,
            and maintainable business logic, and configuring webhooks and websockets for real-time communication and data
            exchange. I have worked for companies like Trucker, TIONIX, and Flussonic, where I have utilized technologies
            such as Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Sidekiq, Redis, Sentry, and ClickHouse to support platform
            performance and scalability. I also have experience in deploying pg, sidekiq, and redis on both Heroku and VPS
            platforms.
